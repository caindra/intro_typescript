* This project was created using Vite

## Create a project using Vite

1. Create the project:
   ```bash
   npm create vite
   -- write your project\'s name, now choose a framework, which in my case was 'Vanilla', and a variant, whichc for me was 'TypeScript'

2. Access to the project directory on your terminal and install all needed packages:
    ```bash
    cd <your-projects-name>
    npm install

3. Run npm on dev:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
